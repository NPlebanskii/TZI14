the behaviour of the cars in transitional zone and buffer-sluice is defined on t
he basis of the collected statistical data which describe distribution of transp
ort flow on the city territory during day. the automatic decision of planning an
d organizing of the traffic for group of connected crossroads of the city distri
ct provides synchronizing and allows to minimize the delay on the most loaded ro
utes by transition from package switching, formed by cars or pedestrians, to cha
nnel switching. the identification and verification of the proposed models are f
ulfilled on the basis of the experimental researches, which are carried out with
